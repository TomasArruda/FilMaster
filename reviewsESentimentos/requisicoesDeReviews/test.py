	["When Criterion revealed Need For Speed at E3 earlier this year, my initial reaction was why the hell are they calling this Most Wanted? I got over that pretty much immediately when they showed gameplay, and they won me over right there and then. Since June, I have been awaiting the release date anxiously. Here we are now, with my review of NFS: Most Wanted.There's no menu when you launch the game, a title screen asking you to press start is all you get. After the initial load screen you get a fancy stats screen telling you the percentage complete, time played, etc, it's a cool touch. Then you jump in your first vehicle right before this though, you get a little cut-scene explaining the objectives.NFS: Most Wanted is an open-world driving game from Criterion games, creators of Burnout: Paradise City and Hot Pursuit. You race, perform tasks and escape capture from police to earn speed-points, which tie into the single-player and the very different multi-player. The whole point of the campaign is very similar to the original Most Wanted, there's a list of 10 cars you have to beat to becomes the notorious driving master of the city. The problem with this is it made since back then, it was complete with a story-line and characters. This 2012 game however lacks any of that stuff, it's just a list of cars, that's all. I don't exactly have a vendetta against this, it remains to be fun, but it'd be better with characters.The gameplay feels very familiar, drifting, driving fast, maneuvering feels like a breeze immediately. The objectives include some Burnout stuff like crashing through fences, jumping into billboards, performing take-downs and more. The new goals include speed-traps "jackpots", which are just finding hidden cars, therefore unlocking the ability to use them. All these objectives get sucked into the autolog, and if you have friends playing this, it can be a blast. My want to top out buddies' top speed, jumping further and finding more jackpots or fenced off areas is oddly addicting. Not only that but it also let's you know your friends' results in races, police pursuits, stunt runs and other objectives and give you more speed points if you defeat them. The autolog was a great addition to the NFS franchise back on Hot Pursuit and it remains to be awesome in Most Wanted.The EasyDrive menu is a fantastic new addition to Criterion games, it's so simple and yet does so much. All you need to do is press right on the d-pad and you're in it. It pops up from the upper left corner, and allows you to change and upgrade your car, find races, go online and more. There's also a pause menu, that allow you to see detailed stats, the map, options and more.The catch-up AI is where the single-player goes wrong, it makes it so frustrating at times. Especially with the police, and they are not the best part of the game to begin with. More often then not, you'll think you are eluding the cops only to see them magically go 1000mph on the mini-map and be on you immediately. It doesn't happen as much with the AI racers, however they are immune to the spike-strips, only your tires are vulnerable to them. It's not fair and it's very annoying.The campaign is also on the short side for a Criterion title. If all you want to do is complete the Most Wanted list, you could do it in around 4-6 hours. To 100% the game will take a bit more time, although it's no where near the amount of time I spent with Burnout: Paradise City.The multi-player shines through but it's not without flaws either. It's just a great idea, I love how quick in it to just drop into a game. Once in the game, you are just free-roaming until the speedlist activates. The speedlist is a list of 5 events that players will be put through, it could be races, team objectives, car specific goals and more. When this occurs though, you don't get whisked away to it, you must drive to a "meet-up" where the objective starts. The first person there gets a bonus, so it can be fun to try to take-down opponents and screw around with them. If the mission is not a race, take-downs actually eliminate opposing racers, they can still participate in trying to mess up your game, but their scores won't count post take-down. The major flaw in the online is people can just quit whenever they please, be it they have an appointment or they rage quit, they do not get punished at all. The game also doesn't feature drop-in/drop-out, so quitters fundamentally break the game. Another problem is the EasyDrive menu doesn't pause the game, so you could be trying to change cars and upgrade it, but you can't do it when someone takes you down, which will happen alot. All of this is such a shame as well because the game is so much fun.The game is really good looking, from the car models, to the traffic, to the buildings, to the sense of speed, it's all super nice. The cut-scenes are also super well done, some have cool color filters, some are just straight up crazy and feature things such as a tornado made of cop cars. They are all a cool watch and make you want to find all the cars and perform all the missions. The menus all show off well, give you the info you want and transition into the screen The only minuses I could give the graphics are the crashes, they sometimes they look great, but cars don't crunch up or deform at all. The frame rate is also unsteady and dips more than I'd like it to. It's minor gripes in a fantastic graphical presentation though.Lastly, the sound effects and music are all fantastic. The way the crashes, small scraps and scratches and rubber burning resonant is all great. I have zero complaints in the sound effect department. The soundtrack might not be stuff I'd normally listen to, but it really does get you in the mood to drive recklessly and that's what you want. The only minus I could give it, is you cannot see the full list and edit some off of it, but the game does support custom soundtracks.Overall I'm giving this a 4/5, only because of the problems. It's extremely entertaining, and I will be addicted to it for the foreseeable future. If my concerns were to be fixed via patch or addressed in the next title, it'd easily bump up my score but unfortunately it's hard to over look them.",
	"Need for speed Most Wanted is the most entertaining need for speed game released to dat topping the likes of the original most wanted and Hot Pursuit. It draws many elements from 2008's Burnout Paradise and is equal parts fun with multiplayer and almost as good in the single player.",
	"While I am still waiting for a racing game that adds to the flavor of Burnout Revenge, with Crash mode and all the hectic goodies, this is about as solid an arcade/fun experience with a racing game as I've had since 2005.The biggest jump in the game as a NFS game is the accessibility of it all. You have access to a fair number of cars off the bat. Any race you have tried you can jump to in the game menu. You can switch to cars in the menu. It is all very quick, and feels much better than Paradise.The biggest gripe from my side is the pretty cheap AI. Most Wanted cars will be taken down, get back in the race and be ahead of you five seconds later. Taking down a Most Wanted car after beating it can be weird, as the opponent will crash and this is the only time you have a shot at it. Teleportation AI and a feeling of cheapness are aggravating.The open world design comes packed with an amazing amount of great spots. Airfields, industrial sites and cliffside locales are all adding to a solid overall experience.Highly recommended. Enjoyed it much more than 2010's NFS Hot Pursuit.",
	"Need for Speed: Most Wanted was one of my most anticipated titles going into 2012. I was looking forward to Criterion developing another game in the series, and was interested in what direction they would take after their last endeavor, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit. Hot Pursuit followed the format of most arcade racers at the time with a shallow and focused single player, and a multiplayer that relied upon short bursts of competition (5 minute races). All in all, it was one of my favorite racing games of all time and featured some of the most entertaining multiplayer found in a video game.The newest game in the Most Wanted line of Need for Speed games continues this trend of exciting multiplayer, but has a single player that could simply not exist, and the game would probably be better for it.I began my experience with the game in the single player mode to familiarize myself with the game play and to see what kind of offering they had come up with this time around. You are dropped into an open world and given instructions to race to a particular spot where you soon enter into your first car. From there you have a choice of five races to enter into with that car...and that's it. The races are tied to each car (some of them overlapping) and the only purpose they serve is to unlock parts (mods) for your cars. Natural thought processes led me to think that doing this would get me better cars to use online (complete with maxed out mods). Unfortunately, that is not the case. And even worse, this is not made apparent to the player anywhere within the game, at least that I could see. I'm not sure if they thought their open world was so cool that players would simply want to drive around in it? I guess I am trying to say that the single player is very poorly done and is meaningless to anything other than itself. There is no storyline, no progression, and no fun. I didn't even mention how the cops simply serve as an annoyance and there is no great benefit to escaping them (as Jeff mentioned in his review). The game also somehow managed to look significantly worse (maybe it is my imagination) than I remembered Hot Pursuit looking. But if there is one saving grace to this game (and it is a big one), it is the fast paced multiplayer that can't be found in any other racing game out there.The multiplayer takes place in the same world and area as the single player with up to eight players in a single match. It revolves around "speed lists" that are compiled automatically in player matches, and can be completely customized in private matches. These lists are a series of five events that can vary from races to team races to challenges. Once an event is queued up, the players must race to the "meet up point" and wait for everybody to arrive before the match can start (players that don't show up are teleported, or kicked if inactive). Once it does start, all hell breaks loose. Depending on the types of competitors one is up against, they might try to take each other down thereby eliminating part of the competition (in races it simply serves as an inconvenience, whereas in challenges a player can be prevented from scoring). Challenges can range from drifting, remaining parked (still) on platforms, and jumping the farthest distance. Some challenges are group challenges where the collective score is what matters, but people will still try to mess their competitors up (even in group challenges there are bonuses for the highest scoring player). Basically, the multiplayer is a test to see who can be the biggest jerk, and it is absolutely as fantastic as it sounds.Even the multiplayer is subject to problems including glitched patches, glitched events, and a distinct lack of thought put into the track layouts (there are problem spots on certain tracks that affect everybody). I also would have liked to have seen clearer indications of where the track is headed, as often times the player will end up flying by the turn only to realize it seconds later. Ultimately, the weaknesses of the game are outweighed by the over-the-top fun of the online experience.Although the game has glaring problems, a lack of focus, and seems to be technically broken in some ways, it is still one of my favorite games to come out in 2012 and I would recommend it to anybody looking for a unique multiplayer experience.",
	"To be clear this review comes from the PC side, the console experience maybe different as the autolog feature can add a lot so if you're like me and you have only a few people on Origin then autolog leaves a lonely void on you.With that said, the single player is boring. It seems like it should be pointed out that if you're looking for a single player arcade style game avoid this one at all costs and just buy Hot Pursuit.It's hard to even know where to start with what i feel is wrong with this game.Fuck da PoliceSo lets talk about the value of the Police in the game. The police only have one real event forcing you to ditch the cops and recording your time to do so, outside of that they'll show up in yet another race to act as a nuisance but really they just feel like an after thought, an obligation to throw into a game called "Most Wanted" and when you're free roaming it's a far better solution to just let youself get busted so you can move on to the next event The lack of a Cops Vs Racers in multiplayer is a sleazy obvious omission so they can add it later as DLC.On The Track...And that's exactly what it is, "a track" which is fine for the most part but ared by poor design decisions throughout this game. The level design; you know that dirt road that in every other racing game is a shortcut, well here it maybe a road that leads you astray from you next checkpoint forcing you to U-turn and tag the checkpoint before you can continue to the next forcing you to wonder why they made this an open world game if they're just going to force you onto this path.Despite that, it isn't a horrible idea to have a check to check race but it's made horrible by poor communication in the game's UI, i've seen check markers that were vaguely between a split road and have been unfortunate enough to take the wrong road in the split. Normally in these games you have a big green wall of arrows pointing you to the right path and REJOICE, it has that wall of arrows...it's just not sure when it should use it which makes having the wall even worse as you plow head long onto the wrong road assuming since you saw no wall that you, at the very least, could connect back to the track on a different path. Think again, you have to go back to that last check point.The CarsThe handling in the cars from the beginning have that heavy arcade feeling. Not light and responsive as in Burnout and i remember enjoying the handling in Hot Pursuit much more, you then discover you much win races to mod your car to be less shitty which is easy enough to do. You also crash, a lot, which is a mechanic that seems devised solely to justify the "make your car sturdier" mods which will lower your overall speed in most cases.Unfortunately when you find a car that you like to play with you can max out it's usefulness into the overall "become the most wanted" conceit that drives the single player experience.This Most Wanted event is the only part of the game that lets you freely choose a car you want to drive. It's a one on one race with police thrown and when you finish the race you have to take down your opponent in an effort to make take-downs relevant to the single player. Problem is, it's either easy to the point of being pointless as the AI plows into police blocks and traffic, or you end up losing your target, usually from crashing to much, and you just wait for him to spawn next to you so you can try again...yeah, he literally spawns next to you at full speed eventually...once he telefragged me as i was parked.InterfaceI don't feel it's as slick as everyone seems to make it out to be, maybe that's because i constantly hit the back button on my 360 controller when i want to bring up the "press right on your direction pad" menu...why just "right"? why doesn't touching the directional pad in ANY direction bring up the menu?Besides that, the worse offender is in trying to compare vehicles. when searching for a new car to use it's a process of hitting "right-down-down-right-down-down-left-down-right..." like you're punching in the Konami code.This problem became far more obvious when in multiplayer as i tried to mute random players who either don't realise their mic is on or think there's an audience for the white noise of their air conditioners with layers of vague voices in the background. They don't give you any indication of who's talking, which i remember being a problem in Hot Pursuit's multiplayer, so you have the tedious task of going through the "Player" list punching in the mute code of "right-right-left-down" on every name down the list until you no longer hear that dudes air conditioner...and realise someone ELSE has their air conditioner running, "right-right-left-down-right-right-left-down-right..."The interface is far from "snappy". The game chooses what it wants to show you and you can't cancel out of anything, you want to change cars right now? well wait a second while the interface shows you want your current car is equipped with, now wait a little bit longer, when you can see the menu, THEN you can use it. Maybe i'm just impatient, it happens when i'm not enjoying myself.MultiplayerSo here is where the redeeming qualities are suppose to come to play, but i feel like i'm at the dismay of PC gaming in the console age. So early on my experience seems to be marred but what i can only ASSUME are technical problems with the server. I jump into a game, i meet up at the "meet up", everybody on the list has checks by their names, the "relocating players" countdown is at 0s, and...nothing happens...and nothing continues to happen for a very long time. I eventually get impatient and log off this mystery server only to match make onto what seems to be the exact same server still waiting for something to happen. So i leave multiplayer to come back to it later as i'm trying to find reason to like this game at all.I don't know if the match making is THAT amazing but so far in my frantic effort to mute every player in the room i have yet to hear one speak english, you would think that location would be a priority in match making. So you know there was some lag going on. cars warping in here and there. Once i was chasing a flickering car and suddenly he teleported right behind me, AMAZING! But the cars you can see lagging aren't the problem, it's the cars that spawn directly in front of you, collision detection and all, that are a problem.Eventually i did get into a semi functional multiplayer session and a lot of the interface problems spring up again, even worse this time as it cancels your menu every time someone takes you down while you're just parked trying to look through your list of cars. Also that long drag of waiting for the map to show up can be an annoyance as you have no idea which direction to go to get to the "meet up" until the interface decides to show you the map.Regardless, one of the nicest parts about the multiplayer is that your points carry over to your single player game so you can earn points to unlock the Most Wanted list without the chore of playing the single player game...but then you can't carry over the cars from single player to multiplayer, as far as i can tell...so there's really NO reason at all to play the single player.Multiplayer is amusing but i wouldn't call it amazing, there's a learning curve to the challenges. It's not always clear why you're getting points. In one challenge i was parked on top of a building gaining points as an accumulation timer ticked up for the group...i guess it was a king of the hill type situation where you had to sit on the roof without getting tapped by the other players which resets your score, i still have no idea what that was all about but i came in first place so apparently i'm amazing at it.The challenges ask you to read a ticker for information on what you're suppose to be doing while you're trying to keep your eyes on the road and get to your next objective, this is the perfect time to feature the nice lady voice over to, at least once, explain the basis of each challenge. It's a learning process, if you're patient enough to play it over again i'm sure you'll eventually figure everything out but it is not noob friendly and i'm not that patient.Ultimately to enjoy the multiplayer you have to give up certain needs, such as the one for speed as an example. The multiplayer is a score fest that's better served if you don't take it too seriously, but i guess Want For Score didn't look right on the box. Racing is an occasional means with which you can get score but really it's a slap happy score game.As far as the future, i just feel that shiver of EA creeping around the corner with that Cops VS Racers DLC as if to say, "Oh shit! Guess what we JUST thought up guys". I kind of hope it never happens, then i don't have to worry about what EA is doing with Criterion and i won't have to be cautious of Burnout games in the future.So in ConclusionFuuuck this game....at least on the PC anyway.",
